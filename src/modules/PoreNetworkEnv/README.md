# Pore Network Environment

Environment to perform Pore Network Model operations.

Modules:

- PN Extraction: Creates a Pore Network Model from a binary or labeled volume.
- PN Simulation: Performs single-phase or two-phase flow simulations on a PNM.
- Cycles Visualization: Visualizes two-phase simulation steps.
- Production Prediction: Creates production prediction with the Buckley-Leverett equation from two-phase Krel results.
