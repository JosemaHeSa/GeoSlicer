# Image Tools

_GeoSlicer_ module to allow image manipulation, as described bellow:

1. Select the _Input image_.

2. Select the _Tool_ and make the desired changes.

3. Click the _Apply_ button to confirm the changes. These changes are not permanent and can be undone by clicking the _Undo_ button; they will be forgotten if you leave this module without saving or click the _Reset_ button (resetting will rollback the image to its last saved state). You can make the changes permanent by clicking the _Save_ button (this will change the image data and cannot be undone anymore).
