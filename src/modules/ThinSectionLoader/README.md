# Thin Section Loader

_GeoSlicer_ module to load thin section images in batches, as described in the steps bellow:

1. Use the _Add directories_ button to add directories containing thin section data. These directories will appear at the _Data to be loaded_ area (a search for thin section data in these directories will occur at one subdirectory level down at most). You can also remove unwanted entries by selecting them and clicking _Remove_.

2. Set the _Pixel size_ (in millimeters).

3. Optionally check _Try to automatically detect pixel size_. If successful, the detected pixel size will replace the configured _Pixel size_.

4. Click the _Load thin sections_ button and wait for completion. The loaded images can be accessed from the _Data_ tab, under the _Thin Section_ directory.
